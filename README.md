## Known Issues
Mass deleting records quits early with timeout error. It would seem the more 
records that are being deleted adds an exponential increase in wait between 
deletes. So far in testing >= 47 (254) 114 at once results in timeout-error.


Phantom v4.2 and earlier has completely broken pagination. You will receive 
duplicate and missing records. You should set the query filter 'page_size' to 
a number greater than the max expected results in order to receive all records 
in a single page.
